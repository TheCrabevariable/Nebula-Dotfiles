This repository is an Arch one, using pacman and flatpak in hyprland. 
the reason i use official packages and flatpak is to update in one command and keep it simple.
if you like part of it you can always change parts you don't like, or take inspiration.

for all package either flatpak or pacman you can look into the wiki 

Time to Rice
